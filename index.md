# Jack Moul's First CS193 Homework
## Things I'm loving about CS193
- Markdown is pretty *cool*. That's not a pun. But it could be. If only we could embed a formatting type with ice powers...
- The lectures are laidback but fun.
- We're using great tools (I've used them before but they're still great).

wobsoite thx
